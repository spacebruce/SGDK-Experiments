# Big virtual scrolling tilemap

A reasonably succesful attempt at shrinking VRAM usage by only allocating what's actually needed to the screen, allowing very big and graphically diverse maps.
Uses more CPU and RAM (not VRAM) than I'm super comfy with, but does seem to do it's job well when given adequate resources.
